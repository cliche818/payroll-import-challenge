# Wave Software Development Challenge

Applicants for the Full-stack Developer role at Wave must
complete the following challenge, and submit a solution prior to the onsite
interview.

The purpose of this exercise is to create something that we can work on
together during the onsite. We do this so that you get a chance to collaborate
with Wavers during the interview in a situation where you know something better
than us (it's your code, after all!)

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to
complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the
challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your
time and are happy to leave things open to discussion in the on-site interview.

Please use whatever programming language and framework you feel the most
comfortable with.

Feel free to email [dev.careers@waveapps.com](dev.careers@waveapps.com) if you
have any questions.

## Project Description

Imagine that this is the early days of Wave's history, and that we are prototyping a new payroll system API. A front end (that hasn't been developed yet, but will likely be a single page application) is going to use our API to achieve two goals:

1. Upload a CSV file containing data on the number of hours worked per day per employee
1. Retrieve a report detailing how much each employee should be paid in each _pay period_

All employees are paid by the hour (there are no salaried employees.) Employees belong to one of two _job groups_ which determine their wages; job group A is paid $20/hr, and job group B is paid $30/hr. Each employee is identified by a string called an "employee id" that is globally unique in our system.

Hours are tracked per employee, per day in comma-separated value files (CSV).
Each individual CSV file is known as a "time report", and will contain:

1. A header, denoting the columns in the sheet (`date`, `hours worked`,
   `employee id`, `job group`)
1. 0 or more data rows

In addition, the file name should be of the format `time-report-x.csv`,
where `x` is the ID of the time report represented as an integer. For example, `time-report-42.csv` would represent a report with an ID of `42`.

You can assume that:

1. Columns will always be in that order.
1. There will always be data in each column and the number of hours worked will always be greater than 0.
1. There will always be a well-formed header line.
1. There will always be a well-formed file name.

A sample input file named `time-report-42.csv` is included in this repo.

### What your API must do:

We've agreed to build an API with the following endpoints to serve HTTP requests:

1. An endpoint for uploading a file.

   - This file will conform to the CSV specifications outlined in the previous section.
   - Upon upload, the timekeeping information within the file must be stored to a database for archival purposes.
   - If an attempt is made to upload a file with the same report ID as a previously uploaded file, this upload should fail with an error message indicating that this is not allowed.

1. An endpoint for retrieving a payroll report structured in the following way:

   _NOTE:_ It is not the responsibility of the API to return HTML, as we will delegate the visual layout and redering to the front end. The expectation is that this API will only return JSON data.

   - Return a JSON object `payrollReport`.
   - `payrollReport` will have a single field, `employeeReports`, containing a list of objects with fields `employeeId`, `payPeriod`, and `amountPaid`.
   - The `payPeriod` field is an object containing a date interval that is roughly biweekly. Each month has two pay periods; the _first half_ is from the 1st to the 15th inclusive, and the _second half_ is from the 16th to the end of the month, inclusive. `payPeriod` will have two fields to represent this interval: `startDate` and `endDate`.
   - Each employee should have a single object in `employeeReports` for each pay period that they have recorded hours worked. The `amountPaid` field should contain the sum of the hours worked in that pay period multiplied by the hourly rate for their job group.
   - If an employee was not paid in a specific pay period, there should not be an object in `employeeReports` for that employee + pay period combination.
   - The report should be sorted in some sensical order (e.g. sorted by employee id and then pay period start.)
   - The report should be based on all _of the data_ across _all of the uploaded time reports_, for all time.

   As an example, given the upload of a sample file with the following data:

    <table>
    <tr>
      <th>
        date
      </th>
      <th>
        hours worked
      </th>
      <th>
        employee id
      </th>
      <th>
        job group
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        2020-01-04
      </td>
      <td>
        10
      </td>
      <td>
        1
      </td>
      <td>
        A
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        2020-01-14
      </td>
      <td>
        5
      </td>
      <td>
        1
      </td>
      <td>
        A
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        2020-01-20
      </td>
      <td>
        3
      </td>
      <td>
        2
      </td>
      <td>
        B
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        2020-01-20
      </td>
      <td>
        4
      </td>
      <td>
        1
      </td>
      <td>
        A
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

   A request to the report endpoint should return the following JSON response:

   ```javascript
   {
     payrollReport: {
       employeeReports: [
         {
           employeeId: 1,
           payPeriod: {
             startDate: "2020-01-01",
             endDate: "2020-01-15"
           },
           amountPaid: "$300.00"
         },
         {
           employeeId: 1,
           payPeriod: {
             startDate: "2020-01-16",
             endDate: "2020-01-31"
           },
           amountPaid: "$80.00"
         },
         {
           employeeId: 2,
           payPeriod: {
             startDate: "2020-01-16",
             endDate: "2020-01-31"
           },
           amountPaid: "$90.00"
         }
       ];
     }
   }
   ```

## Jeff Documentation

#### Installation instructions
used ruby version 2.7.1 to develop, uses sqlite for relational database
prerequisites: requires rbenv/rvm for installing ruby and gem install bundler

1) run bundle install
2) run migrations:
  a) rails db:setup
  b) RAILS_ENV=test rails db:setup
3) for unit tests: rspec
4) to run the server: rails s (will be available at localhost:3000 by default)

#### available routes
1)

2) /payroll_report - returns the report of all EmployeeTime from all imported csv files so far

#### High level design

##### Helper Libraries
time_report_csv_importer - responsible for taking csv file path and saving EmployeeTime records plus extra data (pay period start and end date for easier report generation)
pay_roll_report_generator - run SQL to generate the payroll report

##### Models
EmployeeTime - represents each line in the imported csv + additional information (used for generating payroll report)

##### Non database models
EmployeePeriodPayrollReport - represents each line in the generated report (hold data and help with displaying)

##### Questions 
1) How did you test that your implementation was correct?
- having unit tests
- running it locally (upload the csv file and hitting the payroll report to see the generated report + some spot checks from the csv to generated report)

2) If this application was destined for a production environment, what would you add or change?
- use PostgreSQL or MySQL for the relational database since sqlite is for prototyping only
- add a linting program like Rubocop (easier to add it now than later where there could be very different code style across the files)
- add a CI pipeline (something that will run all the unit tests when a commit or PR is merged to master)

3) What compromises did you have to make as a result of the time constraints of this challenge?
- handling edge cases for csv imports, currently assuming best case scenario only 
  edge case ex:
    -if two csv files import the same record, what happens?
    -if duplicate records happen in a same file, what happens?
- handling the csv import asynchronously via a background worker like Sidekiq (might not be needed, depends if the csv file will be big)
